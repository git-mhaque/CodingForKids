## Learning to code and have fun
This is an initiative to teach coding/programming concepts to school kids.

This is a fun activity for school kids to learn coding concepts with the help of a parent or an adult who has some fundamental coding concepts. 

The kids will be building a game by completing a series of lessons while learning various coding concepts and having fun at the same time. 

## What will we build? 
We will be building a single-player 2D game with multiple moving enemies and treasure objects. The objective of the player is to collect all the treasures by avoiding any collisions with the enemies. The player will lose health if collided with an enemy. The player will also lose a life when the health indicator becomes empty. A player will have three lives to complete the mission by collecting all treasures. 

## What concepts will we learn? 
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE)   
- Organization of source code files 
- Using built-in functions 
- Variables 
- Creating functions 
- Conditional logic 
- Control flows 
- Loops 
- Arrays 
- Class and object 
- Array of objects 
- Random number generation 
- Calculations

## Pre-requisite software 
- Mac or Windows 
- Visual Studio Code 
- Node.js 

## Setting up the development environment 
1. Download and install `Visual Studio Code.`
2. Download and install `Node.js.`
3. Download the `CodingForKids` project from [github.com](https://github.com/git-mhaque/CodingForKids) as a zip file by selecting `Code` and then `Download ZIP.`
4. Extract the zip file. 
5. Run `Visual Studio Code.` 
6. Open the extracted folder in `Visual Studio Code` by selecting `File` and then `Open Folder.`     
7. Open a new terminal in `Visual Studio Code` by selecting `Terminal` and then `New Terminal.` 
8. Finally, run the following commands in the `terminal` one after another. 

```
    npm install 

    npm run start
```
9. The above commands will open a page on the browser which will automatically refresh as you change your code. 
10. Open the `LessonGuide.md` and start with `Lesson 01 Guide.` 
11. Have fun!
